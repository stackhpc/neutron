issues:
  - |
    When using ML2/OVN, during an upgrade procedure, the OVS system-id stored
    value can be changed. The ovn-controller service will create the "Chassis"
    and "Chassis_Private" registers based on this OVS system-id. If the
    ovn-controller process is not gracefully stopped, that could lead to the
    existence of duplicated "Chassis" and "Chassis_Private" registers in the
    OVN Southbound database.
fixes:
  - |
    A new OVN maintenance method ``remove_duplicated_chassis_registers`` is
    added. This method will periodically check the OVN Southbound "Chassis"
    and "Chassis_Private" tables looking for duplicated registers. The older
    ones (based on the "Chassis_Private.nb_cfg_timestamp" value) will be
    removed when more than one register has the same hostname, that should
    be unique.

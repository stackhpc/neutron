    The OVN changed support for NAT rules including a new column and
    auto-discovery logic to know about logical router gateway ports for NAT on
    a Logical Router.
features:
  - |
    A new OVN driver Northbound DB column has been added to allow configuring
    gateway port for NAT rule. If the OVN backend supports the `gateway_port`
    column in the Northbound DB NAT table, the gateway port uuid will be
    configured to any floating IP to prevent North/South traffic issues.
    Previously created FIP rules will be updated only once during the
    maintenance task to include the gateway_port reference (if OVN backend
    supports it). In case all FIP entries are already configured no maintenance
    action will be performed.

    Fix an issue in the OVN driver where network metadata could
    become unavailable if the metadata port was ever deleted, even
    if accidental. To re-create the port, a user can now disable,
    then enable, DHCP for one of the subnets associated with the
    network using the Neutron API. This will try and create the
    port, similar to what happens in the DHCP agent for ML2/OVS.

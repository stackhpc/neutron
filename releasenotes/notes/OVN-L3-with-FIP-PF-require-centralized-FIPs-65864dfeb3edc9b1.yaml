    When the following configuration is enabled at the same time:

    * OVN L3 service plugin (``ovn-router``)
    * Port forwarding service plugin (``port_forwarding``)
    * "vlan" or "flat" network types configured in the ML2 configuration
      variable ``tenant_network_types``
    * The OVN floating IP traffic is distributed
      (``enable_distributed_floating_ip`` = ``True``)

    the Neutron server will report a warning during plugin initialization
    because this is an invalid configuration matrix. Floating IPs need to
    always be centralized in such a case.

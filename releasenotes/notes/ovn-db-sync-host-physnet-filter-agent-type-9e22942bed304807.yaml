    When synchronizing the OVN databases, either when running the migration
    command or during startup, the code responsible for synchronization will
    only clean up segment-to-host mappings for hosts with agent_type
    ``OVN Controller agent``. Before, the synchronization would clean up
    (delete) segment-to-host mappings for non-OVN hosts. Fixes bug:
    `2040172 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/2040172>`_.

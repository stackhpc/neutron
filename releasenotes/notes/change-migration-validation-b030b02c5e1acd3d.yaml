    The OVN migration performs validation by default. This validation means an
    instance is spawned and is tested by simple ping after the migration is
    finished. Also it tries to create new workload post migration. This is
    useful for very simple scenarios when migration is tested but is not
    really useful in production since likely the production envrionments
    already have running workloads. It makes more sense to require the
    validation explicitly rather than implicitly run it as the migration
    is mostly intended for production. The VALIDATE_MIGRATION now defaults to
    False and needs to be changed to True if validation upon request.

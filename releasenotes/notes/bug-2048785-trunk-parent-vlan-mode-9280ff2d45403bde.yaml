    The fix of `bug 2048785 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/2048785>`_
    only fixes newly created trunk parent ports. If the fix of already existing
    trunks is needed, then either delete and re-create the affected trunks
    or set tpt ports' vlan_mode and tag manually:
    ``ovs-vsctl set Port tpt-... vlan_mode=access tag=0``

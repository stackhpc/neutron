    The `redirect-type=bridged` option is only used if all the tenant networks
    connected to the router are of type VLAN or FLAT. In this case their
    traffic will be distributed. However, if there is a mix of VLAN/FLAT and
    geneve networks connected to the same router, the redirect-type option is
    not set, and therefore the traffic for the VLAN/FLAT networks will also be
    centralized but not tunneled.

    [`bug 2003455 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/2003455>`_]
    As part of a previous commit
    (https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/neutron/+/875644) the
    `redirect-type=bridged` option was set in all the router gateway ports
    (cr-lrp ovn ports). However this was breaking the N/S traffic for geneve
    tenant networks connected to the provider networks through those routers
    with the redirect-type option enabled. To fix this we ensure that the
    redirect-type option is only set if all the networks connected to the
    router are of VLAN or FLAT type, otherwise we fall back to the default
    option. This also means that if there is a mix of VLAN and geneve tenant
    networks connected to the same router, the VLAN traffic will be centralized
    (but not tunneled). If the traffic for the VLAN/FLAT needs to be
    distributed, then it should use a different router.

    The new value for 'device_owner' for OVN loadbalancer health monitor ports
    (ovn-lb-hm:distributed) is now supported by Neutron, providing a LOCALPORT
    behavior to these ports. The responsibility to define these ports with the
    new value instead of the old one (network:distributed) is under the
    OVN-Octavia Provider driver, which will take care of database conversion
    for these ports.

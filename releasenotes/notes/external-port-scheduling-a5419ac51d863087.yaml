    A new ovn-cms-options option called ``enable-chassis-as-extport-host``
    is now recognized by ML2/OVN and is used to identify nodes that are
    eligible for scheduling OVN's external ports. This feature is backward
    compatible and if no nodes contain this new option the external
    ports will continue to be scheduled using the ``enable-chassis-as-gw``
    option as before.
    This change also introduces a limit to the number of members for each
    HA Chassis Group to 5, matching the limit of gateway router port
    replicas. This is because OVN uses BFD to monitor the connectivity
    of each member and having an unlimited number of members could
    potentially put a lot of stress in OVN.

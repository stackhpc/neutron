    [`bug 2003455 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/2003455>`_]
    It is added an extra checking to ensure the "reside-on-redirect-chassis"
    is set to true for the logical router port associated to vlan provider
    network despite having the "ovn_distributed_floating_ip" enabled or not.
    This is needed as there is an OVN bug
    (https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2162756) making it not work
    as expected. Until that is fixed, we need these workaround
    that makes the traffic centrallized, but not tunneled, through the node
    with the gateway port, thus avoiding MTU issues.

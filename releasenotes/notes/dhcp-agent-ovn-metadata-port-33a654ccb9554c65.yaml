    Fixed the scenario where the DHCP agent is deployed in conjunction with
    the OVN metadata agent in order to serve metadata for baremetal nodes.
    In this scenario, the DHCP agent would not set the route needed for the
    OVN metadata agent service resulting in baremetal nodes not being able
    to query the metadata service. For more information see
    `bug 1982569 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/1982569>`_.

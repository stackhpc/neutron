    [`bug 2036705 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/2036705>`_]
    The Neutron ``port.status`` field ("ACTIVE", "DOWN") is now set based on
    the ML2/OVN Logical Switch Port ``up`` and ``enabled`` flags. The user can
    now set the ``port.admin_state_up``, that is replicated in the
    ``lsp.enabled`` flag, to enable or disable the port. If the port is
    disabled, the traffic is stopped and the ``port.status`` is set to "DOWN".

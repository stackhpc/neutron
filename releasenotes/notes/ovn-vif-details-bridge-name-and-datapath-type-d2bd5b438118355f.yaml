    [`bug 2045889 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/2045889>`_]
    The ports bound to ML2/OVN now contain the OVS bridge name and datapath
    type in the VIF details dictionary. NOTE: in the ML2/OVS to ML2/OVN
    migration, the local host OVN bridge (integration bridge) per port is not
    known; "br-int" will be used by default (that value is rarely changed).
